        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As for me, dreams will happen to me everynight. Sometimes I can clearly remember what happened in my dream last night, that feeling , which makes me surrounded by the real one. why those things can't leave me alone ,even i am unable to go back to that time, maybe that's memory, always means someone. I enjoy that someone who makes me feel tranquil and really know me, for that. I become fagged to simulate to be unreal. If there is no chance to continue, I will focus on myself.</p>
